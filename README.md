```

<a name="examples"></a>

##3\. Examples

Here are some examples of how to use DeBunk.

<a name="example1"></a>

###3.1\. Example 1

```js
var debunk = require('debunk');
debunk.whatDoesThreeEqual(); //3
```

<a name="example2"></a>

###3.2\. Example 2

```js
var debunk = require('debunk');
debunk.whatDoesSeventeenEqual(); //17
```

<a name="example3"></a>

###3.3\. Example 3

```js
var debunk = require('debunk');
debunk.whatDoesThreeEqual() * debunk.whatDoesSeventeenEqual(); //51
```
<a name="example4"></a>

###3.4\. Example 4

```js
var debunk = require('debunk');
debunk.whatProbablyDoesNotEqualSeventeen() //Random number between 1 and 1,000. Could be 17 though, who knows.
```
<a name="example5"></a>

###3.5\. Example 5

```js
var debunk = require('debunk');
debunk.whatDoesSeventeenNotEqual(); //Returns 9, because seventeen does not equal 9.
```

<a name="example6"></a>

###3.6\. Example 6

```js
var debunk = require('debunk');
debunk.whatDoesShibleyHaveToSay(); // "Right on"
```

<a name="testing"></a>

##4\. Testing

Tests are not included in the DeBunk repo to cut down on bloated module sizes. It is, however, important to test your code. DeBunk is compliant with all major testing frameworks. Here is an example for writing tests to make sure DeBunk is behaving properly.

```js
var debunk = require('debunk');
var testPassed = debunk.whatDoesThreeEqual() === 3;
var otherTestPassed = debunk.whatDoesSeventeenEqual() === 17;
```

##5\. Why DeBunk

The main reason why I wrote _DeBunk_ was to solve the recurring need to establish a verifiable value for 3 and/or 17. As I'm sure you've experienced in your coding career, functionally determining the value of 3 and/or 17 can be quite cumbersome. I hope _DeBunk_ can alleviate your coding woes.
